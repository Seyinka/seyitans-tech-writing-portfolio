# Web3 Documentation Project

This project is part of the WriteTech Accelerator Programme and explores technical writing in the Web3 ecosystem. I chose **Option C** and created a white paper to explain how blockchain can improve privacy, transparency, and access in mental wellness applications.

## 🔀 Option Chosen

**Option C – White Paper Draft (for a fictional project)**  
I chose this option because it allowed me to combine my interest in technology and mental wellness. The white paper introduces **CalmFi**, a decentralized mental wellness platform that empowers users to manage their emotional health data securely through blockchain technology. It also demonstrates how tokenized incentives and decentralized identity can enhance user engagement and data ownership in the Web3 era.

## 📄 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| whitepaper.md | A 2-page white paper for **CalmFi**, a decentralized mental wellness app built on blockchain technology. |

## 🌱 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to structure a white paper that balances clarity, innovation, and technical precision.  
I also gained insight into how blockchain concepts such as smart contracts, decentralized storage, and tokens can be applied to personal wellness and data sovereignty.

## Challenges

One challenge was simplifying complex Web3 ideas like decentralized identity and token models for a mixed audience.  
Another was keeping the white paper concise while effectively presenting CalmFi’s mission, technology, and potential impact.
