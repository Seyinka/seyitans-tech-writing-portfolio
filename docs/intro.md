## 💻 Local Development (Optional)

If you want to explore the website locally:

```bash
yarn
yarn start


This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

 ## Build
bash
yarn build

This command generates static content into the build directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment Using SSH:
bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy

Not using SSH:
bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the gh-pages branch
