Reflection: What I Learned

Working on this project taught me several things:  

- **Importance of Clarity**: Explaining cloud concepts simply makes them easier to understand.  
- **Screenshots are gamechangers**: Visuals guide beginners better than text alone.  
- **Optional vs Required steps**: Splitting them helps beginners focus on the basics first.  
- **Docs need flow**: Navigation, step-by-step sections, and troubleshooting make the experience smooth.
