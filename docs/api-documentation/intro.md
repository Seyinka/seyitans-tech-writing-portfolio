## What I Improved

- Organized endpoint documentation into separate markdown files within a `/reference` folder for clarity.  
- Added structured sections for each endpoint including: endpoint path/method, description, parameters, example requests/responses, and error notes.  
- Enhanced readability and developer usability by formatting all examples in consistent Markdown and JSON code blocks.  
- Provided Postman testing instructions to make integration easier for developers.  
- Included a Getting Started guide detailing authentication, headers, and environment setup for the Chimoney Sandbox API.

## Challenges

- Understanding the required parameters for each Chimoney endpoint and differentiating between **query parameters** and **request body data**.  
- Troubleshooting **validation errors**  
- Maintaining clean, human-readable Markdown while embedding formatted JSON responses.  
- Ensuring authentication headers were correctly implemented when testing in Postman.
